# NumericLab

A repo for training and learning numerical methods with C++ (Eigen and xtensor). Here, I provide a numerical stack in Modern C++,
trying to follow C++11 standard and above.

## Purpose

Training. Exercise. And suffering a little bit.

## About me

The name is Diego. Just a developer under development.
